/**
 * Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request
 * into a stand-alone object that contains all information about
 * the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a
 * method arguments, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and
 * support undoable operations.
 * 
 * Applicability:
 * - When you want to parametrize objects with operations.
 * - When you want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely.
 * - When you want to implement reversible operations
